# Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network

* Handwritten digit recognition using Convolutional Neural Network
* Dataset used - MNIST handwritten digit recognition
* Dataset available at - [MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
* I converted the original dataset into png format images.

## To do
- [x] vgg-16 encoder based network
- [x] normal resnet encoder based network
- [x] pre-activation resnet encoder based network
- [x] loss visualization of architectures
- [x] accuracy comparison of architectures

## Accuracy comparison
model | number of epochs | accuracy
------|------------------|---------
vgg   |       300        |   99.3
normal resnet|    300    |   99.47
preactivation resnet| 300|   99.43
