# Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network

* Handwritten digit recognition using Convolutional Neural Network
* Dataset used - MNIST handwritten digit recognition
* Dataset available at - [MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
* Converted the original dataset into png format images.


## To do
- [x] vgg-16 encoder based network
- [x] normal resnet encoder based network
- [x] pre-activation resnet encoder based network
- [x] loss visualization of architectures
- [x] performance comparison of architectures
- [ ] visualization of weights
- [ ] visualization of intermediate feature maps


## Performance comparison
model |      epochs       | accuracy
------|-------------------|---------
vgg   |       300         |   99.3
normal resnet|    300     |   99.47
preactivation resnet| 300 |   99.43
